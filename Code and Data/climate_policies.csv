In the electricity sector, Mongolia planned to increase the production of energy from renewable sources and improve its efficiency in the grid transmission. In the transportation sector, the major target is switch fuel (less carbon intensive) and modal.

The numbers are as follow: (i) In the reference year, a projection of emissions to 2025 (32648,6097 GgCO2eq) and 2030 (37761,1405 GgCO2eq) were foreseen; (ii) In the unconditional scenario, Senegal proposes reductions of 5% (30987 GgCO2eq) and 7% (35106 GgCO2eq) respectivaly to 2025 and 2030 emissions; (iii) In the conditional scenario, the goals are bolder, reaching 23,78% (24883,0564 GgCO2eq) in 2025 and 25,53% (26611,0057 GgCO2eq) in 2030.
The main policy instrument to be set is the carbon market and the main sector to be tackled is the electricity and power, shifting to renewables and for less intensive fuel (e.g. from oil to natural gas) (Senegal NDC, 2020).
The country aims to go an extra mile with international aid mainly in the electricity sector, outlining an unconditional achievement of a cumulative installed solar capacity of 235 MW, 150MW in wind power, 314 MW in hydroelectricity in 2030 and presents a conditional one of an additional solar capacity of 100 MW, 100 MW in wind power, 50 MW of biomass, 50 MW of CSP, by 2030. Moreover, Senegal has a wider goal to reach 999 MW in renewable energies (conditionally) and invest to switch carbon intensive fuels to natural gas in dual thermal power stations (fuel oil / gas), which will bring the total installed 600 MW of natural gas between 2025 and 2030.

According to CAT, the Brazilian updated NDC is weaker than the previous one, being rated 'Highly insufficient"".

It is an economy-wide and absolute pledge, covering all sectors and gases (EU NDC, 2020).
The overarching measures in force in EU are three-folded: Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which is put a price in the carbon and established a cap for emission allowances; by the non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which individual binding targets for Member States is set considering emissions not covered by the EU ETS; and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).
Additionally, the EU passed regulations to improve energy efficiency (improve at least 32.5% by 2030), for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption (at least 32% by 2030) and reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, increasing performance (reducing emissions) of cars and lorries.
The EU agreed to reduce at least 55% GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5°C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%). Also due to methodological complexities caused by Brexit, CAT cannot rate this NDC. Nevertheless, CAT points out that the reduction would have to be between 2,324 – 2,329 MtCO2e or 52.8% (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).
CAT suggests more ambitious policy measures, which would lead to significant reductions. For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the ‘Fit for 55%’ package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.

Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.
The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

However, the targets are conditional to international aid.  The base year used in this NDC was 2011, which the net emissions calculated was 31,998.91Gg CO2e and the BAU was projected for each sector.
In the energy generation sector, Nepal proposes to expand clean energy generation from 1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, being 5,000 MW unconditionally, ensuring that 15% of the total energy demand in the country will be supplied by clean sources.  Nepal also states that 5-10 % of such clean energy will be generated from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the transport sector, Nepal pledges that, by 2025, 25% of the sales of all private passenger vehicles will correspond to electric vehicles (including 2 wheelers), and 20% of all four-wheelers. This target will reduce 8% of the emissions compared with the BAU scenario. Moreover, by 2030 the share of sales will reach up to 90% of all vehicles and 60% considering all four-wheelers, which corresponds to a reduction of 23% compared with the BAU scenario. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the residential sector, Nepal focuses on the improvement of cookstoves, ensuring 25% of electric stoves by 2030 and in the installation of biogas plants (household units and large scale). Nepal aims to reduce 23% of the emissions compared with BAU. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Nepal relies on forest conservation (45% of the country by 2030) and sustainable management of 50% of Tarai and Inner Tarai forests and 25% of middle hills and mountain forests (Nepal, NDC 2020).
Climate Action Tracker (2021) in its own calculation compiling all BAU sectors and sectoral reductions to an economy wide one, outlined that the new conditional NDC would reduce 1.9 – 5.6 MtCO2e, leading to emissions levels between 69 - 76 MtCO2e in 2030.

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The sectors covered by the target are energy (supply and demand), industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste and the gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbon (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
Republic of Korea underscores a plan to reduce its GHG emissions using a carbon market mechanism, the K-ETS, which covers 73.5% of national emissions. Moreover, Korea set its Korean Green New Deal focusing on green transition in cities, low-carbon energy, and innovative less carbon intensive industries.
In the electricity sector it focuses on the reduction of coal power generation through the ban on new coal-fired power plants, switching to eco-friendlier fuels. Also, Korea plans to increase the share of renewable energy up to 20% by 2030. In the industry sector the reliance lies on highly-efficient equipment which will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. In the building sector, Korea pledges to 'greening' public buildings by upgrading standards of energy consumption. In the transportation sector, Korea has set a target of e-mobile vehicles by 2030 and a modal shift in freight transport from road to rail. All of these actions are embedded in the Korean New Green Deal plan (Republic of Korea NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, the update of its NDC is 'Highly insufficient"". The NDC is economy-wide and now has an absolute target: 24.4% below 2017 emissions by 2030. In CAT calculations, this would be equivalent to 540 MtCO2 by 2030. However, these emissions would be reached including international credits and LULUCF sink.

In the electricity sector the government outlines as future actions the development of the country's renewable energy production and investment in energy saving and energy efficient production. Nevertheless, plenty of challenges are also stated such as the high upfront costs. In the building sector the government aims to incite energy efficient appliances, sustainable construction for private and public buildings and shift from conventional fuels to electricity. In the transport sector the focus is on the change of transportation modal to freight trains, reducing the usage of lorries. Also, switching conventional fuels to biofuels and natural gas.
According to CAT, the update of its NDC is rated 'Critically insufficient'. The NDC is economy-wide (including LULUCF) which sets a target of reducing 9% of GHG emissions below BAU, or 903 MtCO2e/yr. The updated conditional NDC target converts to 748 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (excluding LULUCF).

In the electricity sector, United States aims to shift towards carbon-free electricity by 2035, increase energy efficiency, scale up distinct energy sources as hydrogen and invest in carbon capture. In the transport sector the kernel is to switch petrol fuelled vehicles to zero emission ones. Also, raise efficiency standards and investments in both low carbon fuels and alternative transport modals (e.g. rail and biking). In the building sector the focuses are on the enhancement of energy efficiency of electric heating and cooking devices, for instance investing in heat pumps and induction stoves. In the industry sector the government plans to shift fuel burning processes to very low- or zero-carbon processes and to invest in carbon capture. Agriculture and land use are also target by reforestation plans, rotational grazing and forest protection to avoid wildfires.
According to Climate Action Tracker, this target would translate into 1.5-2.5 GtCO2e/yr lower emissions in 2030 below the current policies trajectory. CAT points out that this target includes LULUCF and excluding it would translate to a 43-50% reduction below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).
The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 – PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area – new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.  Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

• Concurrent trends towards decarbonisation of the electricity generating sector are needed.
• The significant increase in electricity demand resulting from electrification policies (e.g., doubling or more by 2050), and electricity exports, should be satisfied through low-carbon sources.
• Canada, and North America’s, electricity future will be shaped by interprovincial and intercontinental cooperation.
• Energy efficiency and demand side management are key to achieving deep GHG reductions.
• Some sectors such as heavy industries, marine transportation, some heavy freight transportation, and aviation could move to lower or low-carbon fuels such as second generation biofuels or hydrogen.
• Abatement of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons, is a priority.
• Behavioural changes will also contribute to a low-GHG economy.
• Focus on cities.
• Canada’s forests and lands will continue to play an important role in sequestering substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
• The private sector has an important role to play in this respect including spurring investment and innovation towards low GHG alternatives. Carbon pricing will be an important element to achieving this objective.
• Collaboration with provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, municipalities, business and other stakeholders.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,Superseded,2016,2016,2050,,Mitigation,https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Canada's%20Mid-Century%20Long-Term%20Low-GHG%20Strategy.pdf,01/01/2022,,,,,

The NDC sets an unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. Also included 2025 as the peak year and a cap of emissions in the current decade of 1100MtCO2e.
For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.
Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).
According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.
While analysing the conditional target of up to 45% GHG emission reductions by 2030 from 2016 levels, CAT concludes that is a bolder target. However, there are no details in the NDC for a complete assessment (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.",Renewables,,Ended,2009,,2020,Unknown,Mitigation,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf,,,,,,

Furthermore, its end goal is to be a net-zero country in 2050.
For that some overarching actions are proposed between 2021 and 2030, for instance set a carbon cap by 2023 and reduce deforestation with international aid to a net zero by 2030 or to 50.000ha unconditionally.
The policy focuses on the 6 mitigation areas, overarching sectors. The NDC presents the use of codes and standards to reduce energy consumption, support sustainable constructions and replace old and out-dated devices and vehicles. The carbon pricing and tax aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels and also create revenue to invest in renewables. In the electricity area, the NDC mentions an improvement in energy efficiency to optimise the dispatch of electrical energy and the promotion and diversification of the energy matrix and exploitation of natural gas from landfills. In the building sector, improving performance appliances are pointed as a way forward. In the transport sector the NDC outlines the creation of a regulatory and financial environment that allows accelerating the transition towards electric mobility and Modernisation of HDV and, lastly, in the industry sector the fuel switch to a less intensive one will reduce the emissions of CO2e and in the LULUCF ecological restoration and reduction of deforestation are the core (Colombia NDC, 2020).

The country projects the BAU scenario to reach 310MtCO2 in 2030. The country  aims to reduce 23.5% by 2030, relative to the BAU scenario (UAE NDC, 2020).
The NDC sets for the electricity sector a goal of 50% share of clean energy (renewables and nuclear) in the installed power capacity mix by 2050, since UAE is investing in solar energy and nuclear energy. UAE is on track to reach 14 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A grid-based clean power, distributed electricity generation, rooftop solar photovoltaic in particular, is being promoted in the Emirate of Dubai. As a last strategy, regulatory measures and technology deployment are envisioned to increase efficiency of energy consumption with an end goal to reduce it by 40% by 2050 with periodic tariff reforms.
In the building sector, codes and standards are the main instrument, with green building regulations and rating schemes for new buildings. Standards and labels may enable informed consumer choices, thus UAE has established an Energy Efficiency Standardization and Labelling Program which covers a range of household goods and appliances. The approach for the industry sector is based on voluntary targets of carbon usage reduction and looking at the transport one a fuel pricing reform (international prices for gasoline, quality standards for fuel and motor and stimulation of a sustainable transport (shifting transport modals for a public one or electric cars) are the strategy disclosed.
CAT calculates the new target to be 246MtCO2 and highly insufficient  and emphasises that there is no mention of net-zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

Costa Rica tackles several sectors, establishing goals to achieve 8% of the country's fleet with zero emissions and also 8% of electric cars by 2030.
In the electricity and heat sector, it supports renewable energy (100% by 2030). Also, codes and standards are set aiming for energy efficiency of end users’ devices and a fuel switch is promoted by a moratorium on exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.
The building sector is tackled with codes and standards driving for a more sustainable construction and material efficiency. Moreover, in the industry sector, renewable and low carbon energy are supported to move away from carbon-based production and towards a circular economy. Fiscal, tariffs and other price instruments are the base to support the forestry sector in order to achieve 60% of forest cover in the country without jeopardising the agricultural sector (Costa Rica NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, Costa Rica’s updated NDC has unconditional targets +2°C compatible. There is room for improvement by specifying the sectoral breakdown or the contribution of the forestry sector, and also by pushing for bolder goals in order to be 1.5°C compatible. CAT calculations show that when excluding LULUCF the total emissions in 2030 will be 12.3 to 12.9 MtCO2e in 2030, though there is some uncertainty due to the forestry contribution (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

Switzerland sets a target of at least 50% reduction of 1990 GHG emission levels (54.1 MtCO2e) by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. Also, Switzerland proposes 75% of the target as a domestic share of its reduction and 25% to be achieved abroad. Besides this single-year target, the NDC also proposes a multi-year between 2021-2030 in which the country will reach an average reduction of GHG of at least 35% below 1990 emissions.
The Swiss government underscores the Energy Strategy 2050 that is yet to enter into force. In this strategy, it is foreseen an increase in renewable sources for power generation, both from hydropower (37,400 GWh) and others (reaching 11,400 GWh). 
The second approach is to halt fossil fuel subsidies, which are being reviewed at national level embedded in a normative goal of transitioning towards a low carbon economy. At international level, agreements of cooperation have been signed with other countries (Switzerland NDC, 2020).
CAT evaluates Switzerland updated NDC 'Insufficient'. The country pledged a reduction of 50% relative to 1990 GHG emissions by 2030 and now the pledge is at least 50% and the pledge to reach net-zero by 2050.  Moreover, according to CAT calculations, the new pledge to achieve 75% of the overall target through domestic emissions reduction can be translated into a domestic absolute target of 37.5% below 1990 levels by 2030, lacking 12.5% to be achieved internationally (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

In this submission, Norway committed to a reduction of at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030 (52 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Norway will implement its NDC jointly with the EU and Iceland, nevertheless it intends to go beyond the EU in the target of 40%, using voluntary collaboration under Article 6 of Paris Agreement.
Economic measures like CO2- taxes and emission trading are central to Norwegian climate policy, but also CCS technologies, electric vehicles and renewable energy will be supported. The following policy instruments are outlined: the EU-ETS; Effort Sharing Regulation (ERS), regulating carbon emissions that fall outside EU-ETS, whereby the Norwegian binding target is to reduce emissions by 40% in 2030 compared with 2005; and LULUCF, which is ought to reach net zero by 2030 (Norway NDC, 2020).
CAT evaluates Norway’s updated NDC as a progress but still insufficient to reach Paris Agreement goals. The present target establishes a reduction of at least 50% relative to 1990 levels by 2030, aiming for 55% (47 – 52% excluding LULUCF according to CAT).

- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

Mexico plans to cover all sectors. In a cross sectoral approach, the main measures outlined are Emission Trade System; Climate Finance Strategy, Circular Economy, Efficient Use of Energy. In the transport sector, Mexico aims the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning. In the electricity sector, it aims to increase participation of renewables, storage and smarter grids. Additionally, in the building sector the focus is on projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions; to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions. Energy efficiency and circular economy are the kernel for the industrial sector.
According to Climate Action Tracker (2020), although both conditional and unconditional remained unchanged from Mexico’s 2016 NDC, its emission projections under BAU has been revised upwards. Therefore, the mitigation ambition has decreased.

For that, Cuba chose to use a variable reference year according to the action posited, ranging from 2014 (e.g. electricity generation based on Renewables) to 2020 (decrease of GHG in swine industry).
Some tasks are underscored, such as the urban planning, reforestation, increase the perception of population and mitigation/adaptation in core sectors.
The Specific Objective 11 and 15 are both related with mitigation practices, the former focusing on to increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources and the latter to Implement economic incentives (taxes, tariffs, credits and others) to achieve financial sustainability in the use and preservation of natural and environmental resources (Cuba NDC, 2020).
The plan encompasses all sectors (general) and touches upon all the mitigation areas analysed. A Climate Finance strategy, energy efficiency, urban planning and direct investments are measures that overarch all sectors aiming a reduction of carbon emissions. In the electricity sector, specifically, the focus is on augmenting the share of renewables and in the building in set standards, relying on solar panels both in residential and industrial areas. The novelty in this document when compared with the 2016 NDC is the inclusion of contributions on transportation, inciting a switch to less intensive or electric cars and forestry (Cuba NDC, 2020).
Cuba aims to increase 24% the energy generation with renewables by 2030 supported by direct investments from the government. Also, Cuba posits to increase energy efficiency, diminishing the use of fossil fuel in buildings and transportation by installation of solar heaters, LED lamps, induction cookers and fuel switch to a less intensive and e-mobile.
In the agriculture and forestry sector, the country posits reforestation as the main action. The commitment is to have 33% of the country covered with forest by 2030.

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.
In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.
Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

The Plan’s objective is to prepare the country’s industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”

- By 2025, overall methane emissions are expected to not exceed 96.4 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), or to reduce by 13.34% below 2020 level. In which, methane emissions, measured in CO2e, are expected to not exceed 42.2 metric tons from cultivation, 16.8 metric tons from animal husbandry, 21.9 metric tons from solid waste management and wastewater treatment, 10.6 metric tons from oil and gas extraction, 3.5 metric tons from coal mining, and 1.3 metric tons from fossil fuel consumption.
- By 2030, overall methane emissions are expected to not exceed 77.9 million metric tons of CO2e, or to reduce by at least 30% below 2020 level. In which, methane emissions, measured in CO2e, are expected to not exceed 30.7 metric tons from cultivation, 15.2 metric tons from animal husbandry, 17.5 metric tons from solid waste management and wastewater treatment, 8.1 metric tons from oil and gas extraction, 2.0 metric tons from coal mining, and 0.8 metric tons from fossil fuel consumption.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency",,"In force",2022,2022,2030,,Mitigation,https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/vie212244.pdf,31/01/2023,,,,,
